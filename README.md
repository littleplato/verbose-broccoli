# Verbose Broccoli

An intelligent email generator for outbound lead generation.

## Development

The project is built with `NextJS` version >13, and it is using `pnpm` as the node package manager.
Naturally, you'll need `NodeJS` version >18. I recommend to use `nvm` for NodeJS version management.

To develop, clone the repo and install the node dependencies

```
git clone git@github.com:weejerrick/verbose-broccoli.git
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
